# Hashtags denote comments.

# You can print simple stings in Python with the 'print' statement. Enclose strings in quotes.
print("test")
print("hello world\nHELLO WORLD\nnew lines\n\n\n\n\nHello World")

#Instead of curly braces, Python uses indentation for blocks. Both 'tab' and four spaces are acceptable.

# Setting a variable equal to 3.
x = 3
# An if statement that is true whenever 'x' equals 3.
if x == 3:
    # Indented over.
    # Printing out 'x equals 3' when the if statement is true.
    print("x equals 3")
